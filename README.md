# To-Do-List
HTML,CSS,JavaScript
In this project, I have created a modern to do list. We can add a new task to the list using the input field. Plus, our to-do list is unique in that even after refreshing the page, the tasks remain saved.  With each task, there are two icons: a check mark and a trash bin. The check mark allows you to mark the task as completed, while the trash bin lets you delete the task. Each task will also be saved in the local storage.
